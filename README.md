# Welcome!
My name is Helena and I am a 4th year CS student at UofT. Overall, I am interested in HCI+AI and I am currently working on putting all my projects, designs, photos and hobbies in one place.

## Tech Stack
**My Swamp** isn't too crazy of a website. It is a static site built with: 
- `React.js`
- `Vite` (_building_)
- `TailwindCSS` (_styling_)
- `Github Pages` (_deploying_)

## Bugs
If you found a bug in my website and decided to find my repo to help a friend out, thank you! Feel free to write an issue or just let me know.
